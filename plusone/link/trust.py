"""Who is who: this PC's identity (a self-signed certificate) and the
tablets the user paired with (their certificates' fingerprints).

Pairing (link.pair) happens only when the user asks for it, choosing the
tablet in Plus One's window: both screens show a six-digit code made from
the two certificates and the user confirms it on both (like Bluetooth's
numeric comparison); then each side remembers the other's certificate. The
code also mixes a random number from each side, the app's committed to
before it sees the PC's: someone in the middle, showing each side a
certificate of their own, cannot make both screens show the same code but
by a one-in-a-million chance.
